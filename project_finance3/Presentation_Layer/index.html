                    <div class="label">Problem Definition</div>
                    <p>A mid-sized business with multiple locations and bank accounts struggled with prolonged month-end closes due to fully manual bank reconciliations in NetSuite. Finance teams downloaded bank statements and exported NetSuite general ledger data, then performed line-by-line matching in spreadsheets. This process required 10–15 hours per account per month, introduced errors in 5–10% of matches, and often left unreconciled variances undetected until external audits. Seasonal sales spikes further exacerbated delays and risks.</p>

                    </h3>
                  </header>

                  <div class="cs-body cs-article cs-text-wrap">
                    <div class="label">Problem Definition</div>
                    <p>A professional services firm with variable client billing cycles relied on weekly manual consolidation of accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll data, and Sage Intacct general ledger exports into spreadsheets for cash flow forecasting. This labor-intensive process introduced inconsistencies, delayed visibility, and produced forecasts with 15–20% variance from actuals, exposing the firm to liquidity risks such as potential overdrafts or missed investment opportunities amid economic uncertainty.</p>

                    <div class="label">Quantitative Analysis</div>
                    <p>The manual forecasting effort consumed 20+ hours per week, equating to over 1,000 hours annually, while inaccurate projections created significant exposure to cash shortfalls.</p>

                    <div class="label">Qualitative Factors</div>
                    <p>Unpredictable client payment patterns and external economic pressures rendered static spreadsheet models inadequate for proactive cash management, limiting strategic decision-making and increasing executive stress around liquidity.</p>

                    <div class="label">Solution &amp; Implementation</div>
                    <p>We built a custom real-time cash flow forecasting platform with seamless Sage Intacct integration via its XML Gateway API for live data synchronization of AR, AP, GL balances, and commitments. Additional connectors pulled payroll and CRM data to capture upcoming obligations and expected inflows.</p>
                    <p>The core engine employed a driver-based forecasting model enhanced by OpenAI API calls to generate intelligent predictions based on historical patterns, seasonality, and client-specific payment behaviors. Users could run unlimited scenarios (e.g., delayed collections, new project wins, expense reductions) with instant recalculations.</p>
                    <p>Key features included:
13-week rolling cash flow views with daily/weekly granularity
Interactive Chart.js dashboards for trend analysis and scenario comparisons
Variance alerts and driver impact breakdowns
What-if simulations with natural-language scenario descriptions
Automated data refresh and secure role-based access
Built on a Node.js backend with PostgreSQL for historical storage, hosted on scalable AWS infrastructure with automated backups.</p>

                    <div class="label">Tech Details</div>
                    <p>Weeks 1–2: Sage Intacct API authentication, data mapping across AR/AP/GL/payroll sources, initial synchronization pipelines, and historical data import.

                    <div class="label">Problem Definition</div>
                    <p>Project managers in a mid-sized engineering and construction firm relied on manual spreadsheets to compile actual costs, forecast remaining expenses, and calculate Estimate at Completion (EAC). This process consumed 8–12 hours per month per project, often leading to outdated insights, delayed variance detection, and inaccurate revenue recognition under percentage-of-completion methods. Without real-time integration to their ERP (Dynamics 365), forecasts were prone to errors from mismatched data, hindering proactive decision-making and risking budget overruns.</p>

                    <div class="label">Solution &amp; Implementation</div>
                    <p>We developed a custom EAC and project planning system that seamlessly integrated with Dynamics 365 to pull real-time actual costs (labor, materials, equipment, subcontractors, and commitments).</p>
                    <p>The core tool empowered project managers to input forward-looking forecasts:
Planned hours for employees and subcontractors
Costs for equipment, materials, and other direct expenses</p>
                    <p>The system automatically loaded indirect costs (e.g., overhead allocations) and applied configurable revenue recognition formulas (such as cost-to-cost percentage of completion) to calculate projected revenue, gross margin, and EAC.</p>
                    <p>Additional functionalities transformed it into a comprehensive project financial management platform:
Interactive charts and graphs for trend analysis (e.g., cost burn rates, variance over time)
Side-by-side comparisons of forecasts vs. actuals from Dynamics 365
Exception reporting and variance alerts to flag potential overruns early
Anomaly detection for unusual spending patterns
Commentary sections for narrative explanations on variances
Mobile-accessible dashboards for on-the-go updates</p>
                    <p>Built with a Node.js backend for robust ERP integration and data processing, paired with a responsive React frontend for intuitive user interaction.</p>

                    <div class="label">Tech Details</div>
                    <p>Weeks 1–2: ERP integration setup (secure API pulls from Dynamics 365 Project Operations data), data mapping for actuals, and initial prototyping of the forecasting interface.
Weeks 3–4: Core dashboard development, including EAC calculations, revenue formula engine, graphs, and client feedback iterations for usability.
Weeks 5–6: Advanced features rollout (exception alerts, anomaly rules, commentary tools), mobile optimizations, and push notifications for critical variances.
Weeks 7–8: User training, performance tuning, and go-live with parallel testing against manual processes.</p>

                    <div class="label">Impact</div>
                    <p>Reduced monthly forecasting time from 8–12 hours to under 2 hours per project.
Annual time savings: 110+ hours per project.
Improved forecast accuracy led to earlier intervention on variances, reducing overruns by an estimated 15–20%.
Estimated financial savings: $11,000+ per project annually (from labor efficiency and better margin protection).

                    <p>A mid-sized manufacturer spent 16–20 hours per monthly/quarterly close cycle manually exporting SAP GL data, mapping accounts to financial statement line items, consolidating adjustments, and drafting management narratives. This error-prone process delayed financial reporting, audit preparation, and strategic decisions. Without structured driver analysis, management reviews often failed to pinpoint the root causes behind variances, limiting actionable insights into revenue and cost performance.</p>

                    <div class="label">Solution &amp; Implementation</div>
                    <p>We developed an one-click financial statement generation platform with secure SAP integration to automate report pulls, apply dynamic mappings, and produce fully formatted P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow statements on demand.</p>
                    <p>The system incorporated advanced driver-based analytics by mapping the company’s revenue recognition formula and identifying key drivers (e.g., sales volumes, pricing, product mix, customer segments). We quantified the relative financial impact of each driver through sensitivity analysis and historical correlations. The same methodology was applied to direct costs (e.g., material usage, labor efficiency, production yields) and indirect costs (e.g., overhead allocation drivers, facility utilization).</p>
                    <p>Key features included:
Dynamic, database-stored mappings with version control and compliance checks for audit readiness
Impact-weighted variance explanations: Automated detection and prioritization of deviations by dollar impact on key metrics

                  <div class="cs-body cs-article cs-text-wrap">
                    <div class="label">Problem Definition</div>
                    <p>A fast-growing technology firm spent 12–18 hours per monthly/quarterly close cycle manually reviewing Oracle financial statements, dissecting variances, and preparing management reports. This labor-intensive process often overlooked subtle anomalies, delayed identification of root causes, and provided limited actionable insights into key revenue and cost drivers. Without a structured approach to prioritize variances by financial impact, management struggled to focus on high-leverage items, leading to reactive decision-making and less accurate forecasting.</p>

                    <div class="label">Solution &amp; Implementation</div>
                    <p>We developed an AI-powered financial analysis platform with automated Oracle statement extraction and advanced driver-based variance analytics.</p>
                    <p>The system began by mapping the company’s core revenue recognition formula and identifying primary drivers (e.g., billable hours, subscription ARR, utilization rates, pricing tiers). We quantified the relative financial impact of each driver using sensitivity analysis and historical correlations. The same rigorous approach was applied to direct labor costs (e.g., headcount, rates, overtime, productivity) and indirect costs (e.g., overhead allocation bases, facility expenses).</p>
                    <p>Key features included:
Impact-weighted variance detection: Automated flagging of deviations prioritized by dollar impact on revenue, gross margin, and EBITDA
Historical trend analysis: AI-driven insights into how driver changes historically affected final results, with explanatory narratives
Guardrails and validation rules: Built-in controls to ensure forecast inputs remained within realistic bounds based on historical benchmarks and business constraints
Closed-loop learning: Monthly actuals vs. forecasts automatically fed back into the model to refine driver assumptions, improve prediction accuracy, and highlight recurring miss patterns
Action-oriented weekly plans: Management dashboards with actionable recommendations on controllable drivers (e.g., utilization improvement initiatives, pricing adjustments)
Interactive visualizations, natural-language variance explanations, trend forecasting, and risk alerts
Built on a Node.js pipeline for reliable data extraction and processing, with AI prompts generating contextual narratives and integrated into intuitive dashboards.</p>

                    <div class="label">Tech Details</div>
                    <p>Weeks 1–2: Oracle data extraction setup, revenue/cost driver mapping, historical data import, and baseline AI prompts for variance detection.
Weeks 3–4: Impact scoring engine development, dashboard integration with automated narratives, alerts, and initial guardrail implementation.
Weeks 5–6: Closed-loop feedback mechanisms, weekly action plan modules, anomaly flagging refinements, and client-specific prompt tuning.
Weeks 7–8: User training, parallel testing against manual reviews, and full deployment with performance monitoring.</p>

                    <div class="label">Impact</div>
                    <p>Reduced financial review and reporting time from 12–18 hours to under 4 hours per cycle.
Annual time savings: 220+ hours.
Significantly improved forecast accuracy and earlier identification of high-impact issues, enabling proactive management interventions.
Estimated annual savings: $22,000+ through labor efficiency and better margin protection.
Transformed finance from backward-looking reporting to a strategic function driving weekly actionable insights on revenue and cost levers.</p>

                      Intelligent Accounts Receivable Monitoring and Collections Acceleration (Integrated with Acumatica)
                    </h3>
                  </header>

                  <div class="cs-body cs-article cs-text-wrap">
                    <div class="label">Problem Definition</div>
                    <p>A growing service-based company faced challenges with elevated Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) due to manual weekly exports and aging reports for overdue invoice tracking. This process consumed 6–10 hours per week across multiple clients, leading to delayed follow-ups, inconsistent escalation, and prolonged payment cycles. Without real-time visibility or predictive insights, collections efforts were reactive, resulting in cash flow constraints and increased risk of bad debt.</p>

                    <div class="label">Solution &amp; Implementation</div>
                    <p>We implemented a real-time AR monitoring system with continuous data synchronization from Acumatica, providing instant access to aging reports, invoice details, and customer payment histories.</p>
                    <p>Key enhancements included:
Historical Analysis & Predictive Insights: Analyzed average payment cycles from prior invoices to establish customer-specific baselines and predict potential delays.
Automated Escalation Workflows: When payments exceeded expected cycles (even before due dates in some cases), the system triggered proactive emails to clients inquiring about delays and gently prompting payment. Escalations progressed automatically (e.g., reminders → detailed follow-ups → involvement of project managers and dedicated collections personnel) for laser-focused resolution.
AI-Driven Prioritization: Risk scoring based on payment history, invoice age, amount, and customer behavior to create prioritized work queues, ensuring high-value or high-risk items received immediate attention.
Multi-Channel Communication: Integrated Slack/email notifications, dispute tracking, and commentary logs for seamless collaboration between project managers, collections teams, and finance.
Additional Best Practices Features: Real-time dashboards with aging visualizations, exception alerts, early payment incentive tracking, and quick dispute resolution tools to maintain positive client relationships while accelerating collections.
This transformed collections from reactive to proactive, aligning with industry best practices like customer segmentation, automated reminders, and cross-functional involvement.</p>

                    <div class="label">Tech Details</div>
                    <p>Weeks 1–3: API synchronization setup with Acumatica, historical data import for payment cycle analysis, baseline aging dashboards, and real-time monitoring foundation.
Weeks 4–5: AI model development for risk scoring, predictive delay detection, prioritized queues, and automated escalation rules with client feedback.
Week 6: Notification integrations (Slack/email), dispute tracking, proactive outreach templates, and performance analytics rollout.
Weeks 7–8: User training, workflow testing, and go-live with parallel monitoring of manual processes.</p>

                    <div class="label">Impact</div>
                    <p>Reduced manual tracking time by over 90%, saving 320+ hours annually.
Achieved 20–30% improvement in DSO, with faster identification and resolution of delays.
Estimated annual savings: $32,000+ through reduced labor, lower financing needs, and minimized bad debt risk.
Improved cash flow predictability, stronger client relationships via proactive communication, and enhanced overall financial health.</p>

                    <div class="label">Problem Definition</div>
                    <p>A mid-sized manufacturing and distribution company relied on complex quarterly spreadsheet models for budgeting and forecasting. Each budget cycle required 20–30 hours of manual data entry, formula maintenance, and consolidation across departments, leaving little time for meaningful scenario planning. In a volatile market with fluctuating raw material costs, labor rates, and demand, the lack of flexible "what-if" capabilities limited agility, often resulting in reactive adjustments, missed opportunities, and suboptimal resource allocation.</p>

                    <div class="label">Solution &amp; Implementation</div>
                    <p>We built a custom Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) platform with seamless Infor ERP integration to pull real-time actuals, commitments, and operational drivers (e.g., sales volumes, headcount, production rates, material costs).</p>
                    <p>The core tool shifted budgeting to a driver-based modeling approach, where users input key business drivers and the system automatically calculated detailed P&L, balance sheet, and cash flow projections. Key features included:
Unlimited scenario planning (e.g., base case, optimistic, pessimistic, cost inflation scenarios) with instant side-by-side comparisons
Real-time collaboration tools allowing multiple stakeholders to work simultaneously with version tracking and commentary
AI-assisted forecasting leveraging historical trends and driver correlations to suggest baseline projections and highlight anomalies
Interactive dashboards with dynamic charts, variance analysis (budget vs. actual vs. forecast), sensitivity analysis, and what-if simulations
Automated rolling forecasts and variance alerts for proactive monitoring
Validation controls to prevent formula errors and ensure data integrity
Built on a Node.js backend for robust data processing and Infor API integration, with a modern React frontend for intuitive, responsive user experience.</p>
